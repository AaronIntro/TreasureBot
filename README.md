## Overview

Probably everybody who studied machine learning thought how to use it to solve financial problem (buy and sell stocks perhaps). A very interesting article shows how to do it with direct reinforcement Learning [1]. We try to impement the idea presented in the article with some slight modification (LSTM instead of recurrent neural network, for example) and some innovative techniques.


## Installation Dependencies:
* Python 2.7 or 3
* TensorFlow 0.8.0
* Numpy 1.11.0

## How to Run?

At the moment, we haven't yet a way to run the script.
